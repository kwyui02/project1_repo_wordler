Created with love by Ashley Franchesca Oca (kwyui02) and Matt Ferrer (mattblferrer)!

### How to Use:
    - Run the Python code main.py.
    - Enter your first word (by default, 5 letters).
    - Enter the color of each letter in sequence, according to the instructions.
    - If you solved the Wordle, great! If not, the program will give you a set of words to try again.
    - Repeat until it's solved, and enjoy!
